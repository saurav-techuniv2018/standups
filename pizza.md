# Pizza

Good morning, my name is Saurav. This is my first standup, so I've chosen a non - technical topic.

I would like to start off my talk by asking you all a simple question. How many of you like Pizza? (Okay | Nice | Great) So, today I am going to speak about Pizza and its history.

Etymologically speaking the exact history of the word "Pizza" is not definite. Some say that it comes from Late latin. "Pitta", which is a round flat bread. Other origins include the word bizzo meaning "mouthful" by the Lombards.

Pizza was initially a food for the poor. This round bread was used as a plate and different types of toppings.
The 'pomodoro' or the golden apple in the pizza didn't make it to Italy until the mid 16th century, centuries after Christopher columbus discovered the Americas.
